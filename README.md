# FullThrottle_Autocomplete_RESTAPI

# FullThrottle Labs Backend Test

## Write a HTTP service that provides an endpoint for fuzzy search / autocomplete of English words.


You are given a dataset that contains 333,333 English words and the frequency of
their usage in some corpus.

Let us assume weâ€™re building a web app where the user types in a single word
from this list in a search box. We wish to autocomplete the input in the search box.


 Your objective is to write a Python app using Django framework that exposes a single endpoint:


 GET /search?word=<input>


 where input is the (partial) word that the user has typed so far.

 For example, if the user is looking up procrastination, the service might receive this sequence of requests:

 GET /search?word=pro
 GET /search?word=procr
 GET /search?word=procra

 The response should be a JSON array containing upto 25 results, ranked by some criteria (see below).

## Constraints

 1.	Matches can occur anywhere in the string, not just at the beginning. For example, eryx should match archaeopteryx (among others).
 2.	The ranking of results should satisfy the following:
a. We assume that the user is typing the beginning of the word. Thus, matches at the start of a word should be ranked higher. For example, for the input pract, the result practical should be ranked higher than impractical.
b.	Common words (those with a higher usage count) should rank higher than rare words.
c.	Short words should rank higher than long words. For example, given the input environ, the result environment should rank higher than environmentalism.
 i.	As a corollary to the above, an exact match should always be ranked as the first result.

 Requirements
- Please add basic documentation for the project and use regular commits with proper commit messages.


- Please host the project in a publicly accessible location for testing like Heroku etc.

 Bonus
- Bonus marks depending on how fast your implemented endpoint works for our input test cases.


- Bonus marks for setting up a basic input box in the frontend which calls your API endpoint on the backend when some input is typed in it.
